# ü™Ñ prettify matlab
A one-stop shop to instantly make your MATLAB scripts and plots beautiful, publication-ready and colorblind friendly.

## üèÅ Installation

To use prettify_matlab:

- clone the repository and it's dependancies 
- add the repository folder to MATLAB's path.

prettify_matlab doesn't use any of MATLAB's add-on toolboxes.

### Dependencies 

- [colorbrewer](https://github.com/DrosteEffect/BrewerMap), to generate colormaps 

- [rgb](https://uk.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/1805-rgb-m) - modified version (called with `prettify_rgb()`) already included. 

## :triangular_flag_on_post: Features
